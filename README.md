# Ongoing Personal Portfolio

This is my portfolio, which is currently in development as I am new to React.js. This version of React.js utilizes Vite, a local development server, and Tailwind CSS. 

## React + Vite

- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

- Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
